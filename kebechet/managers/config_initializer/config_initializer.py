  pretrained natural language processing model
- [Pipfile Requirements](https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/kebechet/managers/pipfile_requirements.html):
  synchronizes `requirements.txt` with a repositories Pipfile dependencies, or entire locked dependency stack
- [Thoth Advise](https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/kebechet/managers/thoth_advise.html): manages Python
  dependencies using Thoth's recommendation system
- [Thoth Provenance](https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/kebechet/managers/thoth_provenance.html): validates
  Pipfile.lock against remote index
- [Update](https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/kebechet/managers/update.html): automatically update
